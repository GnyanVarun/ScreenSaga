Go through the Movie details or Series details of your choice. You can add them to your watchlist, Save them to Collection, Comment on that movie and view the streaming platforms as well. Every action that is taken will be synced with Trakt in real time. You can view the trailer of the respective movie or series via the redirection to YouTube.

The buttons "Watchlist" and "Collection" that are present in the details screen of either movies or series will be contributing to these lists. If a movie or series needs to be marked as watched then we can swipe to the left on the list item and that particular item will be moved to "Watched". Every action is synchronized with Trakt.
